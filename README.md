<h2 align="center">About</h2>
<p align="center">
  GitHub Analyser is an application that can analyze your GitHub profile, compare your profile with some other's profile and get a ready-made resume on the basis of your GitHub profile. 
<br>
In the recent times, GitHub has evolved from more than being a place to keep a record of all your amazing projects 💻 with their respective source-code. It is now a proof of your commitment, urge to solve problems, not just in the DSA questions in the interviews, but those which you notice around, and come up with software/hardware solutions. Having an amazing GitHub profile 🤩 is one of the aims of every developer today.
